        <p>Rohit Sharma became the second Indian to make a century in T20I cricket, thus becoming the highest scorer in a single T20I innings for India. Rohit has been great in Test cricket as well. Rohit is also the 2nd-highest run-scorer in T20Is, only next to Virat Kohli. I love his batting and captaincy whenever he has been a substitute captain. He is cool, calm, composed and aggressive strokeplayer. He is a great opener and also my role model.He is an excellent sportsman and his lifting is unbelievable.</p>
